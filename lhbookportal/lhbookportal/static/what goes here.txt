here, include all the base css which would be used by almost each page.
make directories here to include the css for different functionalities which require different css

example

static
|-->base1.css
|-->base2.css
|-->login
|      |--> login.css
|      |--> register.css
|-->bookings
       |--> new_bookings.css

etc

after changing static files, run
py .\manage.py collectstatic
this puts the content into productionfiles
